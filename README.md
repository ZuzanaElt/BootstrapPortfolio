## Practical

### Navbar use - I had difficulties organising the text in a row on Navbar. The solution was:
 display: flex;
 flex-direction:row;
 jsutify-content:space-evenly;
 align-items:center;

 Also - the Hamburger menu is not opening. After reserarcing this it seems that link to JScript would need to be added. As we did not cover this in our lessons yet, I have decided to leave it as it is. This can be updated once we learn  what and how.

### responsive buttons
 XXX:hover; was added to css
 .btn:hover{
  opacity:0.7;
  color:#0cf9e5;
  box-shadow: grey 0px 3px 8px;
}
